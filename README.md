Hello, this is a copy of the website that I developed for HydratioNation company, which is located in Maryland. I also developed an admin panel for it but I can't make it public. 

The main goal of this project was to create a user-friendly website with the ability to book the procedure and contact the doctor at any time through email. To achieve this, I implemented Postgress DataBase and NodeMailer. 

Stack: TypeScript, Next.js, React, NodeMailer.NextAuth, ChartJS, Prisma, PostgreSQL.
